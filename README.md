This toolbox is used for the the study of Centriole Amplification in Multiciliated Cells. 
The ImageJ plugin was used for the detection of Cen2-GFP+ centrioles at the disengagement phase. Centrioles were then counted with the Cell Profiler pipeline.
The Matlab script was used for the measurement of the mean fluorescence intensity of nuclear stainings in differentiating multiciliated cells.
